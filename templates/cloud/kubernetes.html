            <p>In partnership with Google, Canonical now delivers a &lsquo;pure <abbr title="Kubernetes">K8s</abbr>&rsquo; experience, tested across a wide range of clouds and integrated with modern metrics and monitoring.</p>
            <p>The Canonical Kubernetes works across all major public clouds and private infrastructure, enabling your teams to operate Kubernetes clusters on demand, anywhere.</p>

            <h2>Elasticity built-in</h2>
            <p>Even for experts, installing and operating Kubernetes at scale is daunting. By using Ubuntu and Juju, the Canonical Kubernetes is simple, naturally elastic and integrates with common operations dashboards. Charms deliver the latest stable Kubernetes and Juju makes it easy to manage and grow your cluster.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="box six-col last-col equal-height--item">
            <h2>Your choice of infrastructure</h2>
            <p>The Canonical Kubernetes is certified on most major public clouds and on-premise private infrastructure like VMware, OpenStack or bare-metal MAAS. The ability to move workloads is critical for organisations to remain competitive, foster innovation and avoid infrastructure lock-in.</p>

        <div class="box six-col equal-height--item">
            <h2>Analytics on tap</h2>
            <p>Canonical Kubernetes comes integrated with Prometheus for monitoring, Ceph for storage and a fully integrated Elastic stack including Kibana for analysis and visualisations.</p>

        <div class="box six-col last-col equal-height--item">
            <h2>Cost-effective at scale</h2>
            <p>The major cost of Kubernetes is the  operations expertise needed to run at scale.  The Canonical Kubernetes bundle includes all operational scripting and tooling needed to manage a long-lived cluster, including upgrades and elastic scaling. With Juju you get all the industries best practices for Kubernetes ops for free.</p>
