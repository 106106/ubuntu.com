      <p>If you would like to keep using Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, Canonical is delighted to offer three-additional years of Extended Security Maintenance (ESM) available with the Ubuntu Pro 16.04 LTS premium image or through an <a href="/advantage">Ubuntu Advantage subscription</a>.</p>
      <p>The best option depends on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS compute spend. Ubuntu Pro 16.04 is priced at 3.0-4.5% of of your average compute cost of your existing 16.04 LTS instances, or alternatively you can get an Ubuntu Advantage subscription starting at $75 per VM per year. You can also consider migrating to Ubuntu 18.04 LTS or Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, which are both under standard maintenance until 2023 and 2025 respectively.</p>
