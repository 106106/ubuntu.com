        Stay focused and productive in a fast-moving landscape of code and data.
      </p>
      <p>
        The complexity of AI/ML spans infrastructure, operations, machine
        learning model development, model evolution, model deployment and
        updates, compliance and security. To add to the challenge, the speed of
        innovation in open source machine learning means that complexity is
        compounding annually.
      </p>
      <p>
        That’s why it pays off to bring Canonical and data scientists in early.
        The right resources and experts accelerate delivery and keep your team
        focused on your particular data streams and particular business
        objectives.
      </p>

      Produce tangible results in one week with agile AI technologies and
      methodologies
    </p>
    <p>
      The core of our one week engagements centers on the AI design sprint - an
      introduction our AI technologies and methodologies. We will develop a
      proof of concept (PoC) that solves a real business challenge for your
      organization. The results of this sprint will serve as a foundation for
      your AI innovations.
    </p>
    <p>
      The key outcomes that you can expect from this week are a baseline
      architecture for iterative solution development – which includes a working
      continuous integration pipeline – and a high level strategy that addresses
      your AI transformation journey. Please note: this week typically relies on
      having the right infrastructure in place to support the AI technology
      stack.

        <strong>Discovery:</strong> Following a consultative whiteboarding
        session to set the stage, partner data scientists and data engineers
        will explore your business requirements, expected outcomes, data
        sources, potential opportunities and risks. The partner will discuss
        machine learning use cases for your industry and explore the specific

        <strong>Assessment:</strong> Domain experts will provide initial

        make solution recommendations. They will discuss building a strategy
        roadmap for the project based on your specific business case. Any

        <strong>Design:</strong> Prototype new solutions and identify a
        candidate solution that seems to be the best fit for the use case under
        consideration. Data engineers should prepare the data. Data scientists
        will discuss and select appropriate features and machine learning
        algorithms. Machine Learning engineers will design, build and perform
        preliminary tests on your prototype neural network. Time permitting,
        start the iterative process of design and discovery on the data and the
        neural network model.

        threshold. Build a pipeline that will put your model into a suitable
        environment for testing and feedback from additional stakeholders.
        Domain experts will offer guidance on assessing machine learning
        predictions and putting discovered insights into action.

        between development and operations teams to ensure they can operate the
        solution. It is important to discuss production deployment options – for
        example, a dark launch or an integration with a prototypical business
        application. During this step we’ll elicit feedback from key

      <h2>Perfectly portable AI workloads</h2>
      <p class="p-heading--four">
        Open and pluggable machine learning workflows for multi-cloud AI, ML and
        DL.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the multi-cloud AI world, where AI practitioners leverage multiple
        environments, portability requirements surface rather quickly. We
        consider each environment to be different and in need of the ability to
        define a repeatable machine learning stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        The full AI/ML workflow starts with the developer workstation, for rapid
        iteration of algorithms and analytic techniques. Training at scale takes
        place on the rack or on GPGPU-accelerated instances on the cloud.
        Resulting models are then delivered to the point of decision, whether
        that’s on cloud or IoT at the edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with Canonical and all the leading clouds, Kubeflow on Ubuntu
        provides infrastructure and operations that span that full range, and
        seamless portability of AI workloads.
