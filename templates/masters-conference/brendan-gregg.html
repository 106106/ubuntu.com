      <p>Extended BPF is a new type of software and the first fundamental change to how kernels are used in 50 years. It is already in use by major companies: Netflix has 14 BPF programs running by default on all of its cloud servers, which run Ubuntu Linux. Facebook has 40 BPF programs running. Extended BPF is composed of an in-kernel runtime for executing a virtual BPF instruction set through a safety verifier and with JIT compilation. So far, it is used for software-defined networking, performance tools, security policies and device drivers with more services to come. It is changing how we use and think about systems. This talk explores the past, present and future of BPF, with BPF performance tools as a use case.</p>
