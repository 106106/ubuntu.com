      <h2>Clear privacy policy</h2>
      <p>Ubuntu Appliances comply with established privacy policies. Users should be able to trust in the devices they use at home, in the office or in the factory. They deserve total transparency regarding what happens with their data. Publishers of Ubuntu Appliances will disclose their use of data, should their users require the information. Detailed information can be found on the governance page or in Canonical’s own <a href="/legal/data-privacy">privacy documentation.</a></p>

      <h2>Security first</h2>
      <p>Ubuntu Appliances are designed to make your devices worry-free. Each benefits from the advanced security features of <a href="/core">Ubuntu Core</a>. Served applications are packaged as <a href="https://docs.ubuntu.com/core/en/guides/intro/security" class="p-link--external">snaps</a> &mdash; a format that strictly confines and monitors software to mitigate cybersecurity risks. Ubuntu Appliances provide the highest level of endpoint security even for the most casual use cases.</p>

      <h2>Always fresh</h2>
      <p>Ubuntu Appliances are always synced with the latest stable application release, thanks to automatic updates. You can opt-in to sync on beta and candidate releases. Your device will fetch and install software updates at a regular frequency. Leveraging Ubuntu Core’s resilient software update mechanism, Ubuntu Appliances self-heal in case of failed updates.</p>

      <h2>Community and commercial</h2>
      <p>Commercial software can be both good and popular. Limiting Ubuntu Appliances to open-source, community-driven software only would limit users in the appliances they can create. In the portfolio, whether an appliance is commercial or community-driven is clearly marked. If a user would prefer to only have open-source or commercial Ubuntu appliances the option is available. </p>
