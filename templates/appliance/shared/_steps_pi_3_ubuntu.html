    Generate Secure Shell (SSH) keys
  </h3>
  <div class="p-stepped-list__content">
    <p>
      The ‘Secure Shell’ protocol provides access to your Ubuntu Appliance and uses cryptographic keys to authenticate you to the device. You will need SSH software and keys.
    </p>
    <p>
      Run the following commands:
    </p>
    <pre><code>mkdir ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
ssh-keygen -t rsa</code></pre>
    <ol>
      <li>
        This starts the key generation process. When you execute this command, the <code>ssh-keygen</code> utility prompts you to indicate where to store the key
      </li>
      <li>
        Press the <code>ENTER</code> key to accept the default location. The <code>ssh-keygen</code> utility prompts you for a passphrase
      </li>
      <li>
        Type in a passphrase
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      You now have a public and private key that you can use to authenticate. Next place the public key on your Raspberry Pi so that you can use SSH-key-based authentication to log in.
