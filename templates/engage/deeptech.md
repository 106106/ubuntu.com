Deep tech can be characterised as risky, challenging, innovative technologies that solve real world problems. Whilst the term is not yet ubiquitous, emerging areas of deep tech today include autonomous vehicles, Internet of Things, robots, deep learning and virtual reality as well as some underlying enabling technologies. Three attributes in particular characterise deep tech: the potential impact they can have on society, the long development time they need to reach market-readiness and the significant amount of capital required to develop and scale.

Ubuntu was created on the premise that future innovation would be primarily software-driven and that to foster innovation, it is necessary to empower innovators with free open source software. In this webinar, we will discuss how innovators can leverage Ubuntu as a platform to realise the potential of their technology endeavours and share examples of exciting deep tech innovations that are being delivered on Ubuntu.
