One of the biggest hurdles in the cloud is the management and data protection of your workloads. This is especially challenging in the context of OpenStack as it does not provide a built-in backup and recovery solution. In response, Canonical and Trilio have collaborated to introduce a new solution that expands Charmed OpenStack with the addition of the TrilioVault data protection platform.  These capabilities enable organisations to build resilient cloud architectures, meet service level agreements and adhere to compliance requirements. 

Join our webinar to learn: 
- How TrilioVault provides OpenStack users with a native backup and recovery solution
- How TrilioVault can be easily deployed in a Charmed OpenStack environment
