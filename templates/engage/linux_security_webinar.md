Ubuntu is built with security in mind from the outset, which is one of the reasons itâ€™s such a popular Linux distribution used by developers. The security team at Canonical is constantly working to review threats, fix vulnerabilities and upgrade security capabilities for releases to protect your systems and workloads in production.

Get the full Ubuntu security story and see how our teams are securing Ubuntu systems across open, multi-cloud infrastructures.

In this webinar, join our team to learn how:

- Ubuntu is built with security in mind from the ground up, and how we keep you protected against major vulnerabilities
- Security and support is provided for a full range of open source technologies
- Specific security services that can help you achieve maximum availability by reducing downtime and providing access to high and critical CVE fixes
- Ubuntu helps organisations remain compliant with government and industry standards and regulations, including Common Criteria EAL2 with FIPS 140-2 Level 1 certified crypto modules
