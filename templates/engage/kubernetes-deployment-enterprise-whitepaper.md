As Kubernetes adoption spreads from early adopters to slower-moving enterprises, many companies are discovering that while containers and Kubernetes offer advantages around development, velocity, agility, and cost management, they also create a new set of challenges to overcome.

While there are commonalities in the types of challenges enterprises encounter with Kubernetes, there’s no true one-size-fits-all way to manage them but rather a number of potential approaches, each with its own advantages and drawbacks.

In this white paper and webinar, we examine the motivations most enterprises have when they adopt Kubernetes, the approaches available and the considerations to be taken into account depending on an enterprises’ own size, technical sophistication, current infrastructure and budget.
