Every day, organizations of all kinds and sizes choose to harness open source innovation as part
of their development and operations. Many have embraced Linux and are now adopting open
source beyond the core platform, as evidenced by the widespread adoption of ecosystems like
Python, Node.js and Go, and workloads like Kafka, Redis and Elasticsearch. From retailers to
financial services enterprises running on Microsoft Azure, Ubuntu has rapidly become a
preferred platform to harness that innovation.

But how can organizations balance the fast pace of community-driven open source innovation
with their own imperatives of security, compliance and support? And what does an open source
security strategy mean for enterprise environments?

In this webinar, you&rsquo;ll learn how Microsoft and Canonical are partnering to ensure every
organization can achieve more through open source software in a trusted way &mdash; with no
compromises on security and support. In addition to covering features of Ubuntu Pro for Azure
such as Livepatch, Extended Security Maintenance and FIPS/Common Criteria, weâ€™ll share our
roadmap and joint vision for open source security and compliance in the cloud.
