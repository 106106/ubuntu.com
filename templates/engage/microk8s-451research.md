Cloud native software such as containers and Kubernetes and IoT/edge are playing a prominent role in the digital transformation of enterprise organisations. They are particularly critical to DevOps teams that are focused on faster software releases and more efficient IT operations through collaboration and automation. Most cloud native software is open source which broadens the developer pool contributing and customising the software. This has led to streamlined versions of Kubernetes with low footprints which are suited for IoT/edge workloads.

Read this report from analyst firm, 451 Research, to learn more including:  

- How the maturity of IoT and the value it brings is underpinned by the right technology stack
- The factors driving execution venues for IoT workloads
- The requirements needed to maximise usage of Kubernetes at the edge
