In the fast-paced world of IoT, being able to reduce time-to-market is a priority. Rigado’s core mission is to provide scalable and secure infrastructure for their customers’ commercial IoT deployments.

It became clear to Rigado that, to achieve the ease of use it was looking for, it needed to redesign its gateway software – and containerisation emerged as the best way. After looking at a number of container options that involved a lot of moving parts, Rigado decided to turn to Ubuntu Core and snaps. Switching to Ubuntu Core has also enabled Rigado to take advantage of Ubuntu Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) to rapidly launch Ubuntu instances in AWS.



<blockquote class="p-pull-quote--small">
  <p class="p-pull-quote__quote">We mainly use AMIs for our build servers, but whenever I need a Linux machine for something quickly, my go-to is to spin up an Ubuntu AMI on EC2 – both because it’s easy, and because I trust it. We have confidence in the pipeline Canonical and Amazon have created.</p>
