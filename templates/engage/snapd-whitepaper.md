With the modern proliferation of IoT devices, delivering reliable software updates to low-powered, inaccessible, and often remotely administered embedded systems has become a major challenge. With traditional update mechanisms, faulty updates can cause IoT devices to become unstable, and fixing them requires costly manual intervention through on-site engineer visits or device recalls.

Ubuntu Core solves the update problem for IoT devices regardless of fleet scale. Packages on Ubuntu Core are delivered through snaps – a secure, confined, dependency-free, cross-platform Linux packaging system – which enable automated and transactional updates that are either 100% successful, or are not installed.

In this whitepaper, you will learn:

<ul class="p-list">
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">How the design of snaps makes Ubuntu Core inherently secure and easy to maintain</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">How vendors can deliver automated updates to devices while retaining complete control over which users receive updates, and when</li>
  <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">How delta updates save bandwidth and reduce cost of ownership for IoT devices</li>
</ul>
