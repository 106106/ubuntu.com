        <p>The phase change from traditional, monolithic software to multi-host microservices-based big software demands that you approach the challenge of deployment, integration and operations from a different perspective.</p>
        <p>This eBook explains how we used to do things, why that is no longer an economically viable approach, and what can be done to achieve technical scalability without the large economic overhead of traditional approaches to modern software.</p>
		<p>This eBook will give you a deeper understanding into why there is a perceived complexity to the installation and operations of OpenStack and how tools like Canonicalâ€™s OpenStack Autopilot can help you build a modern, scalable, repeatable and affordable private cloud infrastructure.</p>
