        Every day, various groups at AT&T use open source innovation as part of their development and operations. Many have embraced Linux and are now adopting open source beyond the core platform, as evidenced by the widespread adoption of ecosystems like Python, Node.js and Go, and workloads like Kafka, Redis and Elasticsearch. Ubuntu is a preferred platform running on Azure to harness that innovation, and Canonical &mdash; the company behind Ubuntu &mdash; has created a private Ubuntu Pro offer for AT&T to get updated, supported Ubuntu with special pricing and custom SLAs for AT&T.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this webinar, you’ll learn how AT&T and Canonical are partnering to ensure you can achieve more through open source software in a trusted way &mdash; with no compromises on security and support and with pricing that makes it easy and cost-effective to purchase Ubuntu Pro using your Azure subscriptions.  In addition to covering features of Ubuntu Pro such as Livepatch, Extended Security Maintenance and FIPS/Common Criteria, we’ll share our roadmap and joint vision for open source security and compliance in public clouds.  You will also learn the details of Canonical’s special offer to AT&T and instructions on how to purchase Ubuntu Pro with your Azure subscriptions.
