And while farms struggle to remain profitable, it won’t be long before those static yields become insufficient to support growing populations.</p>
      <p>Reliance on tractors is at the heart of both of these problems. Not only are tractors immensely costly to buy and maintain, they are also inefficient.</p>

        <p>Robots are cheaper to run than tractors and generate far higher yields thanks to AI-driven precision.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Small Robot Company (SRC), a UK based agri-tech start up, is working to overturn this paradigm by replacing tractors with lightweight robots. Developed using Ubuntu, these <a href="/blog/ubuntu-robot">robots</a> are greener and cheaper to run than tractors, and generate far higher yields thanks to AI-driven precision.</p>
