        <p>
          Put simply, edge computing is the method of processing data where it is being generated, at the edge of a network. Doing the work at the edge allows for real-time data-processing without latency and no need to move the huge amounts of data being generated by devices around. Since ‘edge devices’ are integrated into the physical world and interact with people, you can say that the edge is the physical location where things and people connect to the cloud. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Join our upcoming webinar hosted by Galem Kayo, Ubuntu Product Manager, to understand what is driving businesses to process their data at the edge and how you can add an edge computing layer to your business's infrastructure.

        <h3 class="p-heading--four">Using Kubernetes at the edge - architecture and tools for edge clouds and edge devices</h3>
        <p>
          Edge clouds and devices are one of the fastest growing segments for cloud computing. This webinar will dive into the benefits of using Kubernetes as part of your edge strategy - for both edge clouds and edge devices. 
        </p>
        <p>
          We’ll explore use cases, architecture, and tools that will help you at every stage of your development lifecycle - from development to production deployments at scale. Microk8s and Charmed Kubernetes will be explored in sufficient detail to get you started with Kubernetes on Ubuntu.

        <h3 class="p-heading--four">Using MAAS at the edge - The importance of bare metal provisioning in edge computing</h3>
        <p>
          Wide area networks, when managed inefficiently can prove costly for businesses as both hardware and the provisioning of geographically distributed devices can represent a hard cost.
        </p>
        <p>
          Edge deployment costs can be measured in:  
        </p>
        <ul class="p-list">
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Capital and operational expenses</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Power usage</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Dissipated heat</li>
          <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">Real estate occupied</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          For businesses looking to set up servers in remote locations with remote site footprint constraints, MAAS provides a compelling model. 
        </p>
        <p>
          MAAS provides a solution to provision hardware and set-up servers remotely, quickly and with limited human intervention. By deploying MAAS businesses can reduce friction in small footprint environments as well as providing an open API-driven way to provision and repurpose nodes in every remote location enabling fast and efficient server provisioning. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In this webinar join Ubuntu MAAS Product Manager, Andres Rodriguez to discuss use cases and how MAAS could benefit your business.

        <h3 class="p-heading--four"> CTOs guide to the telco edge: from devices to clouds</h3>
        <p>
          The telco edge can take many shapes depending on the geography, the existing network infrastructure, current and future services to be delivered. No two telcos, today, have the same perceived needs.  Additionally, these needs might change drastically depending on what the future holds for new services such as 5G, IOT or AI at the edge.
        </p>
        <p>
          Join Canonical’s telco team to hear about the strategies and tactics you can adopt to build an edge that can match your requirements of today and tomorrow.
