      <p>With Ubuntu OpenStack, you can deploy a cloud infrastructure on your laptop or on a small group of test machines to get your cloud strategy underway. However, the test environment is a lot smaller and a lot simpler than a production cloud, which means a proof of concept can only take you part of the way.</p>
      <p>To make the transition from an Ubuntu OpenStack POC to private cloud in production, you have to be fully prepared for the organisational and technical complexity that
      a cloud infrastructure introduces to your organisation.</p>
      <p>In this eBook, you will learn:</p>
      <ul class="p-list">
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">how to move your Ubuntu OpenStack private cloud from the proof-of-concept stage to a production environment;</li>
        <li class="p-list__item is-ticked">best practices on running your Ubuntu OpenStack private cloud in production and making it future-proof.</li>
      </ul>
