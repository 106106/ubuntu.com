Interana, an analytics software provider, enables users to run advanced big data queries on raw customer data and delivers answers in seconds. Their customers include Microsoft, Comcast and Salesforce. 
 
Interana’s leading-edge platform is based on Ubuntu and deployed directly inside customers’ public cloud environments. This empowers users with some of the fastest analytics capabilities on the market. However, this also means that they have to schedule large-scale data migrations with each client.
 
Due to the large amounts of customer data that Interana handles, ensuring that security was tight was a priority. Rather than rush the upgrade from Ubuntu 14.04LTS, which would have been a major inconvenience for both Interana and its customers, Interana turned to Canonical and ESM. This ensured that their upgrade rollout was secured and controlled.
