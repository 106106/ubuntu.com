SBI BITS provides IT services and infrastructure to the SBI Group &mdash; Japan&rsquo;s market leading financial services company group &mdash; which is made up of over 250 companies, and 6,000 employees.

To increase time to market and meet heavy client requirements, SBI BITs was looking for alternative solutions beyond bare metal servers and decided upon OpenStack. After evaluating their existing suppliers, SBI BITS turned to Canonical to bring in the external support and expertise required to move into production with an economical, flexible solution.

<blockquote class="p-pull-quote">
  <p class="p-pull-quote__quote">There was no risk of lock-in with Canonical’s OpenStack. It’s close to the upstream version, so we have the freedom to fully support internally, if we want to.</p>
  <cite class="p-pull-quote__citation">Georgi Georgiev, CIO, SBI BITS</cite>
</blockquote>

Taking just a few weeks to implement, SBI BITS are benefiting from an OpenStack cloud that is cost effective from both CAPEX and OPEX perspectives and providing them with the confidence to deploy across the entire SBI Group.

In this case study, learn how SBI BITS: 
- Met regulatory compliance through Canonical&rsquo;s OpenStack across two sites, utilising CEPH storage, and deployed using MAAS and Juju. 
- Benefit from ongoing support through Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure to empower the internal team to focus on the core business. 
- Plans to implement Kubernetes, with Canonical support, as a managed service across the SBI Group.
