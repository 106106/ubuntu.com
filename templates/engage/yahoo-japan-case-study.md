Yahoo! Japan, originally formed as a joint venture between Yahoo! and SoftBank, is one of the most popular internet advertising, search engines and e-commerce sites in the country and employs over 6000 people.

Due to having such scale and volume of users, Yahoo! Japan required outside help to build their IaaS (infrastructure as a service) solution and OSS distributed storage solution. In 2013, Yahoo! Japan turned to Canonical and the two companies have grown the relationship ever since.

  <p class="p-pull-quote__quote">During unexpected incidents, the cause needs to be tracked down to the OS layer and being able to ask a professional is a big advantage. I think Canonical is the only company capable of offering this robust support,</p>

</blockquote>

Using Ubuntu and a wide range of Canonical’s management tools, Yahoo! Japan has been able to reduce both CAPEX and OPEX costs while successfully building and operating a large scale IaaS environment.

In this case study, learn how Yahoo! Japan:

- Deployed an [OpenStack](/openstack) private cloud with 1PB of Ceph storage across three regions using <a class="p-link--external" href="https://maas.io">MAAS</a> and <a class="p-link--external" href="https://jaas.ai">Juju</a>.
- Benefited from the reassurance and expertise of Canonical engineers through <a class="p-link--external" href="https://buy.ubuntu.com/">Ubuntu Advantage</a> to ensure unexpected incidents are kept to a minimum.
- Have future-proofed themselves by taking advantage of [ESM (Extended Security Maintenance)](/esm) for security patches until April 2028.
