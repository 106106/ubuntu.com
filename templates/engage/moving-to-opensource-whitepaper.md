Open source software is a critical element of today’s enterprise technology landscape. It drives economic benefits, innovation, and competitiveness, while also delivering advantages around agility, stability, and security – which is why it is being prioritised at both the infrastructure and application layers.

Whereas in the past, many businesses displayed an aversion to open source, the reverse is now more often the case. Open source software such as Kubernetes is central to emergent technology trends, and the prominence of open source will only increase over time. However, this increases the need for businesses to require open source support for reliability, security and regulatory compliance.
