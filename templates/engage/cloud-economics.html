      <p >Analyst firm 451 Research, highlights savings gained from using Canonical&rsquo;s managed private cloud as part of a diverse multi-cloud strategy.</p>
      <h3 style="font-size:24px;">Cloud Price benchmark</h3>
      <p style="font-size:16px;">The new report from 451 Research found Canonical’s managed private cloud to be cheaper than 25 of the public cloud providers included in the Cloud Price benchmark.</p>
      <h3 style="font-size:24px;">Managed private cloud prices</h3>
      <p style="font-size:16px;">Canonical’s managed private cloud, BootStack, was also priced competitively against other hosted private cloud providers, having the second lowest total cost for managed compute, block and object storage in the Cloud Price Index.</p>
      <h3 style="font-size:24px;">OpenStack infrastructure prices</h3>
      <p style="font-size:16px;">One of the significant issues with private cloud infrastructure is the up-front cost of consulting and integration required. Canonical addresses this with a fixed-price, highly automated but flexible OpenStack deployment process that greatly reduces the number of people required for both deployment and ongoing operations.</p>
