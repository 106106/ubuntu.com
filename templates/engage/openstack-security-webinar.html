      <p>Telco, finance, insurance, healthcare, governments are among the regulated sectors, where security and in particular data privacy are fundamental to the design of a private cloud. Openstack is a popular solution to deploy secure private clouds. Implementing Openstack in regulated environments and matching stringent security requirement however can be operationally challenging and costly.</p>
