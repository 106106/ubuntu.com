Private cloud infrastructure remains an essential part of every enterprise nowadays. However, due to the increasing number of workloads and data, the overhead of managing bare metal servers, virtual machines and containers can mount up. Although tools like MAAS, OpenStack and Kubernetes help to address this problem, upskilling operations teams with those tools may take months. As a result, many organisations have started to either fully outsource operations of their private cloud infrastructure or for the initial rollout.

Join Tytus Kurek, Product Manager, and James Troup, Engineering Director, from Canonical in this webinar to learn how outsourcing private cloud infrastructure management help enterprises accelerate the initial deployment and reduce ongoing operational costs.

Tytus and James will present Canonical&rsquo;s approach to hosted infrastructure for bare metal, OpenStack and Kubernetes including the tools and best practices that delivers a production-grade managed service. In addition, they will provide a detailed cost analysis highlighting the savings an organisation can make by outsourcing operations of private cloud infrastructure to a trusted managed service provider.
