As a web-hosting company, GMO Pepabo delivers consumer-targeted internet services, including domain registration, web hosting, ecommerce support and a customer to customer (C2C) marketplace for handmade products. With so many companies depending on its services, GMO Pepabo cannot afford downtime to its mission-critical workloads.

With around 80 physical servers running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS, GMO Pepabo benefits from regular, free security updates delivered by Canonical. These patches ensure that the enterprise&rsquo;s systems are protected against potential vulnerabilities &mdash; however, applying critical kernel updates typically requires rebooting the servers. With multiple people assigned to migrating workloads while machines are rebooted for kernel security fixes, GMO Pepabo realised they needed a more time-efficient and less costly process.

  <p class="p-pull-quote__quote">Livepatch is a perfect fit for our needs. There’s no other solution like it, and it’s highly cost-effective.</p>
  <cite class="p-pull-quote__citation">Shinya Tsunematsu, Senior Engineering Lead of Tech Division, GMO Pepabo</cite>

As a result, GMO Pepabo turned to Canonical&rsquo;s Livepatch &mdash; part of Ubuntu Advantage for Infrastructure &mdash; to automatically apply the latest kernel updates and security fixes without rebooting servers. Patching is completed in microseconds with no interruption to ongoing workloads.
