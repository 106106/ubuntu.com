{% block meta_description %}In Europe, the cost of running a cereal farm – cultivating wheat, rice, and other grains – has risen by 85% in the last 25 years, yet crop yields and revenues have stagnated. And while farms struggle to remain profitable, it won’t be long before those static yields become insufficient to support growing populations.{% endblock %}

      <p>Reliance on tractors is at the heart of both of these problems. Not only are tractors immensely costly to buy and maintain, they are also inefficient.</p>

        <p>Robots are cheaper to run than tractors and generate far higher yields thanks to AI-driven precision.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The Small Robot Company (SRC), a UK based agri-tech start up, is working to overturn this paradigm by replacing tractors with lightweight robots. Developed using Ubuntu, these <a href="https://blog.ubuntu.com/2018/09/13/ubuntu-robot">robots</a> are greener and cheaper to run than tractors, and generate far higher yields thanks to AI-driven precision.</p>
