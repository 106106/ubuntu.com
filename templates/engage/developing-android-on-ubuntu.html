          For developers looking to build Android apps, Ubuntu is the ideal platform in conjunction with Android Studio - the official Android development environment. Ubuntu features a wide variety of software development tools including numerous programming language compilers, integrated development environments (IDEs) and toolchains to enable developers to target multiple hardware platforms.
