      <p>Although critical, seasonal tasks can be dull and are often hazardous for human workers to carry out such as clearing snow from busy airport runways in slippery, sub-zero temperatures during winter. Added to this, finding skilled workers to operate the heavy machinery needed to perform these jobs is reportedly in short supply.</p>
