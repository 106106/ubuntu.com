          </ol>
          <h3>Severity Level 1 — Core functionality not available</h3>
          <p>Canonical will use continuous effort according to the service level purchased, through appropriate support engineer(s) and/or development engineer(s), to provide a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is available, the severity level will be lowered to the new appropriate severity level.</p>
          <h3>Severity Level 2 — Core functionality severely degraded</h3>
          <p>Canonical will provide concerted efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution. As soon as core functionality is no longer severely degraded, the severity level will be lowered to level 3.</p>
          <h3>Severity Level 3 — Standard support request</h3>
          <p>Canonical will use reasonable efforts during the applicable business hours to provide the customer with a work-around or permanent solution as soon as possible, balanced against higher severity level cases. If a work-around is provided, Canonical's support engineers will continue to work on developing a permanent resolution to the case.</p>
          <h3>Severity Level 4 — Non-urgent request</h3>
          <p>Level 4 requests include cosmetic issues, informational requests, feature requests, and similar matters. Canonical does not provide a timeline or guarantee for inclusion of any feature requests. Canonical will review each level 4 case and determine whether it is a product enhancement to be considered for a future release, an issue to be fixed in the current release or an issue to be fixed in a future release. Canonical will review and respond to information requests with a reasonable level of effort during coverage hours. Canonical may close cases representing level 4 issues after responding if Canonical believes it is appropriate to do so.</p>

          <h2 id="appendix-support-hotfixes">Hotfixes</h2>
          <p>To temporarily resolve critical support cases, Canonical may provide a version of the affected software (e.g. package) that applies a patch. Such versions are referred to as “hotfixes”. Hotfixes provided by Canonical are valid until 90 days after the corresponding patch has been incorporated into a release of the software in the Ubuntu Archives. However, if a patch is rejected by the applicable upstream project, the hotfix will no longer be supported and the case will remain open.
