  # Creating takeovers

  A takeover can belong to all or one language parent group. You can build a queue
  of them to rotate based on the user's language settings.
  
  To designate a takeover to display for a specific language parent group, specify
  the "lang" attribute on the <section> container. For takeovers that should appear
  for all languages, simply omit the "lang" attribute.

  NB: Only specify parent language groups (e.g. "en", "de"), *not* derivatives (e.g. "en-GB").

  ## Examples

    <section class="p-strip js-takeover"></section> <!-- For all languages -->
    <section lang="de" class="p-strip js-takeover"></section> <!-- For german languages only -->
#}
