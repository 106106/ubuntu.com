Local development
---

To run the site locally:

``` bash
make run
```

Now visit <http://127.0.0.1:8001>

To see what other `make` commands are available, run `make help`.

Requirements
----

* **Docker** - you will need to download, install and run docker
* **npm**
  * Install the node.js package manager, npm, this might be easier with the node version manager,  [nvm]](https://github.com/creationix/nvm/blob/master/README.markdown). On a Mac with homebrew, try `brew install nvm` and follow the instructions, then `nvm install --lts` to install the long term supported version of node
  * Rebuild the sass with `docker-compose run sass`
  * Restart the server `make stop run`

Notes
----

If you get an ubuntu-vanilla-theme error on first startup, go into your /node_modules/ubuntu-vanilla-theme directory and run:

``` npm install --save-dev gulp-sass@2 ```

then

``` docker-compose run sass ```

and even possibly

``` make stop run ```
