 *
 * Adapted from {@link http://www.bulgaria-web-developers.com/projects/javascript/serialize/}
 * Changes:
 *     Ensures proper URL encoding of name as well as value
 *     Preserves element order
 *     XHTML and JSLint-friendly
 *     Disallows disabled form elements and reset buttons as per HTML4 [successful controls]{@link http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/forms.html#h-17.13.2}
 *         (as used in jQuery). Note: This does not serialize <object>
 *         elements (even those without a declare attribute) or
 *         <input type="file" />, as per jQuery, though it does serialize
 *         the <button>'s (which are potential HTML4 successful controls) unlike jQuery
